# fivem-seatbelt

Original script: [fivem-seatbelt](https://github.com/IndianaBonesUrMom/fivem-seatbelt)

Developed last night on a live server. Hilarious AF so decided to share.  

Demo: <https://gyazo.com/e04eb4641f0f3674912b2b6a1c4cba93>

Launches player through the windshield if a huge change in velocity happens (eg. crash).  

Press K to enable / disable seatbelts.
Make a copy of locale/en.js and edit it to change language. Don't forget to update Config.Locale in config.lua and client_scripts in __resource.lua!

Note: You have to open your seatbelt to leave the vehicle.
